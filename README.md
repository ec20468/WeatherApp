## WeatherApp
A lightweight to-do list application that allows users to search countries/cities and be presented with the location's weather data. Built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  

--- 

## Features

- **Search:** Use the search bar to retrieve weather data.
- **History:** Keep track of previously searched locations.
- **Dynamic Pointer Effects:** Smooth pointer-following animations on the cards.

## Reflection  

- **Context:** This project was a self-initiated challenge to solidify my understanding of core front-end web development principles, particularly interacting with APIs and using the event loop.  
- **Goal:** Build a fully functional weather application that fetches and displays weather and flag data dynamically on a user-friendly interface. This project was aimed at getting hands-on experience with asynchronous functions and the JavaScript Event Loop as well as interacting with APIs.
- **Challenges:**  
  - **API errors:** Handling API errors (and keys) correctly so that the page remains responsive.  
  - **Real-Time Updates:** Implementing the smooth pointer animations.

- **Unexpected Obstacles:**   
  - Keeping the code modular and maintainable in a vanilla JavaScript environment.  

- **Tools & Technologies**:  
  - **Vanilla JavaScript**: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in handling DOM manipulation and event listeners.  
  - **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used for fetching accurate, real-time weather data.  
  - **FlagCDN**: Utilized to dynamically display country flags based on the API response.  
  - **CSS**: Custom animations and pointer-following effects for a modern, interactive user experience.  

This project was a valuable learning experience in deepening my understanding of web fundamentals and improving my problem-solving skills in a pure JavaScript environment.
